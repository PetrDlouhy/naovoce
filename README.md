Na-ovoce.cz
===========

Na ovoce aims to become a web community platform that maps fruit trees, fruit bushes and 
herbs in wild and public spaces. At the same time its activities increase awareness 
of traditional varieties among the general public and contribute to their retention 
in the landscape.
